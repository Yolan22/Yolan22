# Hi there 👋

I'm a Quantum Engineering PhD student at the University of Bristol, specializing in quantum simulations with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.

## 🔭 Research Interests

- **Quantum Optimal Control**: Currently working with the Dressed Chopped Random Basis (DCRAB) algorithm to optimize quantum systems.
- **Experimental Simulations**: Developing simulations for laser physics, Gaussian beam optics, and electromagnetic field modeling to support our experimental setups.
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring deep learning techniques for applications in experimental physics, particularly in imaging Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in optical lattices.:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 🤝 Collaboration Opportunities

I'm open to collaborating on projects involving:

- Modelling Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) system dynamics 
- Optical lattice geometries and Bloch States 
- Quantum applications with ultracold systems e.g., sensing and navigation
- Quantum optimal control algorithms for understanding fundamental physics
- The intersection between Machine Learning and experimnental physics

## 🧠 Seeking Expertise

I'm looking for assistance with:

- Optimization problems and creating robust, efficient optimization models
- Data representation and vizualization  
- Skill building projects for beginners in Machine Learning. General advice, tips, and learning resources are all welcome
